.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libvdsk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In vdsk.h
.Ft vdskctx
.Fn vdsk_open "const char *path" "int flags" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vdsk_open
function opens the device or file given by
.Va path
and according to the
.Va flags
argument and constructs a context to represent the disk.
The context contains
.Va size
bytes of free space at the beginning of it that can be used by the program
for keeping per-context state.
To that end, programs can cast the
.Vt vdskctx
data type to a pointer that can be dereferenced.
